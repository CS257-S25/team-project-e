# Dataset(s) summary

The dataset we are going to use in this project is scraped from an online recipe website and contained a name, instructions, raw ingredients, cleaned ingredients, and image titles corresponding to a folder of images for over ten thousand recipes. The data is initially in a CSV format and we removed the columns for images and uncleaned ingredients in order to shrink the size of the dataset. In our project we will be using just the name, instructions and cleaned ingredients for our website.
